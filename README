Virtual Werewolf Game
email: werewolves@cs.unm.edu

Virtual Werewolves is a Linux based, multiplayer game designed to teach Cybersecurity. Players must exploit inference channels in the Linux kernel to identify other's identities and conceal their own.

Using Werewolves requires at least one routable IP address that the students can SSH to.  If you run Linux in a virtual machine with the Werewolves game on it, the students will need to be able to SSH to the virtual machine somehow.  The two best ways to do this are to either use port forwarding (requires only on static IP address for the host) or to use a bridged adapter (this requires another static IP address for the virtual machine beyond any static IP addresses the host has). If you have any questions about how to set up a virtual machine with Werewolves on it, please email werewolves@cs.unm.edu.
